Base structure for simple C++ projects build using SCons

# Usage

Source files use the `.cc` extension and are located under `src/`. Header files use the `.h` extension and are located under `src/headers/`. The project can be built by issuing the command `scons`. CTags can be generated by executing `./tools/build_tags.sh`.
